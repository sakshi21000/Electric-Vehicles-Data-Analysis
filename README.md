**Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze electric vehicle (EV) trends using Tableau. The dataset includes information on different EV models, their distribution across states, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, and overall growth trends. The dashboard provides insights into the increasing adoption of electric vehicles over the years and the market share of leading manufacturers.

**Process**
Data Collection:
Collected EV data from relevant sources (mention if applicable).
Data includes vehicle models, fuel type, state-wise distribution, and eligibility status.
Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Removed duplicates and missing values.
Standardized vehicle model names and categorized fuel types (BEV/PHEV).
Dashboard Design in Tableau:

Created different visualizations to analyze trends.
Combined multiple sheets into a single interactive dashboard.

**Dashboard Explanation**
The Tableau dashboard consists of multiple visual elements:

State-wise EV Distribution: A heatmap showing the number of electric vehicles in different U.S. states.
Total Vehicles by Model: A table displaying various EV models, their manufacturers, and adoption rate.
CAFV Eligibility: A pie chart categorizing vehicles based on eligibility for clean alternative fuel programs.
Growth Over Time: A line chart illustrating the increase in EV adoption over the years.
Top 9 Vehicle Manufacturers: A bar chart ranking the leading EV brands based on total vehicles.
Key Metrics: Summary cards displaying total vehicles, BEVs, PHEVs, and the average electric range.

**Project Insights**
Increasing EV Adoption: Significant growth in electric vehicle adoption, especially post-2017.
Tesla Dominance: Tesla holds the highest market share (54.06%), followed by Nissan and Chevrolet.
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) vs PHEVs: BEVs constitute 77.6% of the total, indicating a preference for fully electric vehicles over hybrids.
State-wise Distribution: Some states have a higher concentration of EVs, indicating regional adoption trends.
CAFV Eligibility: A large portion of EVs are classified as eligible under clean alternative fuel programs, showing government incentives' impact.

**Final Conclusion**
The analysis highlights the rapid growth of electric vehicles, driven by technological advancements, government policies, and increasing consumer awareness. Tesla remains the dominant player, and BEVs are preferred over hybrids. The insights from this dashboard can help policymakers, manufacturers, and researchers understand trends and plan future strategies for EV adoption.
